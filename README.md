## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a lot of challenges while building this app, firstly with aligments and contraints of labels and buttons having to make sure each thing
was correctly placed and didnt move. Another challenge was connecting connecting all four buttons to the outlet connection, I orginally did it wrong
and didnt realize that I cant just delete the line and do it again. So I restarted the whole thing entirely since my previous project was all over the
place. I figured it out and succesfully connected all four of the buttons to the outlet connection and to the action which was something I also was 
having trouble doing.
